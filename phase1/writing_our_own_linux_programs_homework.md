Writing Our Own Linux Programs
==============================

Prerequesites
-------------

Make sure you've done the [command line arguments homework](command-line-arguments-homework.md) already!
The [Unix1](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/unix1.md) material will be helpful
for some of these.


Reading / Writing files
-----------------------

Terminology (probably put this in your jargon file).

* `file`         - a string sitting on your hard drive
* `read a file`  - load the string from the hard drive
* `write a file` - save a string to the hard drive

* You can read a file with `File.read(filename)`
* You can write a file with `File.write(filename)`
* You can delete a file with `File.delete(filename)`
* You can delete a directory with `Dir.delete(dirname)`
* You can get a list of directories with `Dir.glob("dirname/*")`
* You can get a line of input with `$stdin.gets`
* You can send a line of output with `$stdin.puts`

Instructions
------------

* First try to write each of these programs yourself.
* Then watch the video.
* Then practice the waypoint until you do it in under the specified amount of time.

Waypoints
---------

Do these waypoints until you can do them without referencing the material.
