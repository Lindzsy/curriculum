Mindset of a Learner
====================

Purpose
-------

* How to know what you know, given the massive quantity of unknowns you'll be dealing with constantly?
* Learn how to tell whether what you're doing is effective


Knowledge has no upper bound
----------------------------

You can never reach 100% understanding, instead, as you get closer,
you will discover entire dimensions of context that change how you perceive everything.


Process: Science
----------------

* If you know nothing, "measure" (just get in there and get some info)
* If you have some knowledge, hypothesize (predict other things based on what you know)
* If you know it reasonably, find all the things that don't make sense, and figure out why.


Measuring Knowledge
-------------------

* Predict - the more accurately you can make predictions from it, especially at the boundaries, the better you know it.
* Remove fluff - the fewer unnecessary ideas are mixed with it, the better you know it.
* Consolidate repetition - the simpler your explanation, the better you know it.
* Explain - the more clearly you can explain it, the better you know it.


Maybe worth discussing
