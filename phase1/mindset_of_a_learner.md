Smart is a Choice
=================


Purpose
-------

* Let go of the Maybeline Mindset
* Learn how to tell whether what you're doing is effective


Knowledge has no upper bound
----------------------------

You can never reach 100% understanding, instead, as you get closer,
you will discover entire dimensions of context that change how you perceive everything.


Measuring Knowledge
-------------------

* Predict - the more accurately you can make predictions from it, especially at the boundaries, the better you know it.
* Remove fluff - the fewer unnecessary ideas are mixed with it, the better you know it.
* Consolidate repetition - the simpler your explanation, the better you know it.
* Explain - the more clearly you can explain it, the better you know it.


Maybe worth discussing
