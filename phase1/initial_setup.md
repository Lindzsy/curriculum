Initial Setup
=============

Purpose
-------

* Get everyone's computers working
* Get a development environment set up


Instructions
------------

We'll approximately follow the instructions from the last time I did this:
[link](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles-for-students).


Which environments?
-------------------

* Get a list of all the environments.
* If anyone's seems untenable, they can use https://c9.io/ (will use `apt-get` instead of homebrew)
* Figure out the nuances of their environments so we don't get surprised in class.
