Revisit Synseer
===============

Lets go to [http://synseer.herokuapp.com/](http://synseer.herokuapp.com/).
Clear out your previous results by opening the console
(usually command+option+i), and typing `localStorage.clear()`

Think about mindfulness, read several descriptions,
guess what you think will be on those pages.

Then, within the challenge, read the words in the
hierarchy, go down into the hierarchies,
to see what kinds of things are in there.
You don't need to memorize them, you just need to
get a sense of what things are available, and where
they might be.

Then, trying to keep these things in mind,
read each description, go into the challenge,
and try to identify the correct syntax.

I want you to learn from it, and checking your results
didn't encourage you to do that, so I won't be checking them.
