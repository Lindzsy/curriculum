Tic Tac Toe
-----------

For this game, we'll build a [tic tac toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).


Purpose
-------

* Work in larger teams to get familiar with splitting the work between more
  than just you and a pair, and to get comfortable with the existence of
  code you didn't write but still have to work in.
* Repeat some of the skills we learned this week to see our progress.
* Do a project with more object interaction


Expectations
------------

* My experience as a user of your app is compelling
  (it is fundamentally necessary to analyze your app and decisions from
  the perspective of their impact on your user's experience).
* Primary and secondary functionality should be complete
* Everything should be tested, if you aren't sure how to do it, come ask.

Primary functionality:
----------------------

* I can play Tic Tac Toe against a computer (it is not required to play intelligently)
* I can't interfere with other player's games
* I can watch a replay of my game


Secondary functionality:
------------------------

* I can see my games later, even if I'm on a different computer or my phone
  (eg if you're storing info about me in the db,
  I can prove that I'm the user in the DB with something like [oauth](from_zero_to_oauth.md))
* I can see a list of my previous games
* I can tweet a link to my replay


Stretch functionality:
----------------------

* You can add a feature of your own (play the thing a bit, you need to have the perspective of your user)
* The computer is smart enough to always win
* I can see a list of other players games -- followup functionality: I can mark my games visible / invisible
* I can't interfere with other player's games
* I can play against another human player (careful to think about the implications of this)
* I can see a list of current games and choose to watch them


Advice
------

* If you're not sure where to start, reference our
  [previous project](seeless_project.md),
  [from zero to oauth](from_zero_to_oauth.md).
* Iteratively add functionality.
* Push as often as you have something useful for someone else.
* Pull often.
* Keep in contact with your team, make sure you understand
  how your work and their work fit together.
