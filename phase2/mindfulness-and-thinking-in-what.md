Mindfulness and thinking in what
================================

Lets be curious! Lets be Accepting!
Lets contemplate what a thing does and
not worry about how it does this,
unless it is necessary for our task.

As Corey Haines once said to me last week:
"Trust the abstraction"

This is the only way to succeed at Rails.
But notice that you already do this with
sockets, Ruby itself, Rubygems, your computer,
etc. There are many things we do not know how they work,
but we accept that they work. That will be
incredibly valuable to us as we move forward.
