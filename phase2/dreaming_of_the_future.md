Dreaming of the future
======================

Here are ideas of things we could do!<br />
What within it ignites intrigue in you?<br />


* How about a waypoint for doing the entire first iteration of the
  HTTP project in < 20 minutes? You've struggled through it, you know what's
  in it, but what if you honed it to perfection?!
* [Rails Playgrounds](https://github.com/JoshCheek/playgrounds), a place to practice the topics of Rails,
  all by themselves so that you understand them, then when you use them in your projects, you'll have an easier time
  figuring out "how do I get that form to do that thing?" or "how do I query this kind of database?"
* Build your own blog! You've taken the time to make reflections,
* [Nokogiri Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/parsing_html.markdown)
  This will require you to use pry skills like you've seen me do.
  It's smaller than the rest, but a valuable skill.
* Make your own mini ActiveRecord (if you choose this, I'll make the description and give you the resources)
  This involves metaprogramming :P (mine solution was ~100 lines of code)
* [Contact Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html)
  This is done as a tutorial, so if you feel uncomfortable with all the stuff in Rails,
  there is more to fall back on, but try to figure out how to do things before seeing how the tutorial does them.
  Remember, there is no tutorial at your real job :)
* [Models databases relationships routes controllers oh my](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/models_databases_relationships_routes_controllers_oh_my.markdown)
  Lots of small Rails related tasks to get more comfortable with it.
* [Little Shop of Orders](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
  You will build an online ordering platform. Customers should be able to place orders and view placed order details. The site owner should be able to manage products and categories in addition to processing and completing orders.
* [Api curious](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)
  You'll make queries to a site's API (in this context, that just means you make HTTP requests and they give you back JSON instead of HTML)
  and construct a site that does something fun with their data.
* Become a vim master! Every time you hit some cumbersome editing thing, ask me how I would do it,
  then aggregate a list of examples. If you did this diligently, you could easily get better than me!
  Then I'd become the student O.o how fun would that be?!
* [bEtsy](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/C3Projects--bEtsy)
  You'll construct an [etsy](https://www.etsy.com) like store.
* [SeeMore](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/topic_resources/see-more.md)
  This is another API project (make HTTP requests, get JSON back).
* Construct your own project based on an existing website!
* Make up your own! What's an idea that's important to you? What's a topic that's interesting?
* Build your own Sinatra (I can make up a description if anyone chooses to do this)
* You could jump straight into JavaScript
* Build a Ruby interpreter!
* Write a bunch of sorting algorithms, you could even make visualizations for them like [I did](https://vimeo.com/channels/sortalgorithms)!
* Learn a language we haven't even discussed, like [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
  [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/),
  [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
* Build a database! I've never done this, but I've been wanting to. We might totally fail! ♥️
