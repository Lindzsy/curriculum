Dreaming of the future
======================

Here are ideas of things we could do!<br />
What within it ignites intrigue in you?<br />

* Ruby
  * How about a waypoint for doing the entire first iteration of the
    HTTP project in < 20 minutes? You've struggled through it, you know what's
    in it, but what if you honed it to perfection?!
  * [Nokogiri Challenge](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/parsing_html.markdown)
    This will require you to use pry skills like you've seen me do.
    It's smaller than the rest, but a valuable skill.
  * Build your own Sinatra (I can make up a description if anyone chooses to do this)
  * Build a Ruby interpreter! [Here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/book_club_interpreter)
    is one that some previous students of mine made!
  * Write a bunch of sorting algorithms, you could even make visualizations for them like [I did](https://vimeo.com/channels/sortalgorithms)!
* Rails
  * [Rails Playgrounds](https://github.com/JoshCheek/playgrounds), a place to practice the topics of Rails,
    all by themselves so that you understand them, then when you use them in your projects, you'll have an easier time
    figuring out "how do I get that form to do that thing?" or "how do I query this kind of database?"
  * Would anyone like to build a blog for either yourself,
    or all of us to upload our thoughts to?  That would be really cool!
  * Make your own mini ActiveRecord! This involves metaprogramming :P
    [here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/1bf40c3e44f3347295d5) is my solution,
    I just played with it enough to get the idea of what it does.
  * [Contact Manager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html)
    This is done as a tutorial, so if you feel uncomfortable with all the stuff in Rails,
    there is more to fall back on, but try to figure out how to do things before seeing how the tutorial does them.
    Remember, there is no tutorial at your real job :)
  * [Models databases relationships routes controllers oh my](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/models_databases_relationships_routes_controllers_oh_my.markdown)
    Lots of small Rails related tasks to get more comfortable with it.
  * [Little Shop of Orders](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
    You will build an online ordering platform. Customers should be able to place orders and view placed order details. The site owner should be able to manage products and categories in addition to processing and completing orders.
  * [Api curious](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)
    You'll make queries to a site's API (in this context, that just means you make HTTP requests and they give you back JSON instead of HTML)
    and construct a site that does something fun with their data.
  * [bEtsy](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/C3Projects--bEtsy)
    You'll construct an [etsy](https://www.etsy.com) like store.
  * [SeeMore](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/topic_resources/see-more.md)
    This is another API project (make HTTP requests, get JSON back).
  * Construct your own project based on an existing website!
* Hard Skills
  * Become a vim master! Every time you hit some cumbersome editing thing, ask me how I would do it,
    then aggregate a list of examples. If you did this diligently, you could easily get better than me!
    Then I'd become the student O.o how fun would that be?!
* JavaScript
  * Interested in JavaScript? I found [this](https://github.com/mdn/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/)
    material to be absolutely wonderful!
  * Omg, learn React.js, my colleague [Lovisa](https://twitter.com/applegrain) made
    [this](http://github.com/applegrain/creact) material to teach how to use it from Rails.
    She says "I did the official tutorial - which left much to be desired - and then started working on a small side project. The tutorial I linked to above should be pretty exhaustive in the explanations and geared towards someone that does not have a lot of experience with JavaScript"
    and also "let me know if I can help in any way!", which means that she's available to help you with it!
* CSS
  * [This](http://codepen.io/alexmwalker/pen/paHcG) CSS thing looks amazing!
    I had no idea you could do stuff like that with CSS!
    I kind of want to try it out, interested in trying it out with me?
    [Here](http://www.sitepoint.com/css3-pong-insane-things-to-do-with-css/) is the tutorial.
  * CSS layouts are hard, but they have this thing now called "flexbox" which makes it way easier.
    There's some games
    [1](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/),
    [2](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)
    about how to get it laid out.
    Want to come up with a crazy layout and see if we can't get it figured out, then try the games to fill in the gaps?
  * [This](http://flukeout.github.io/) one is great for figuring out how CSS selectors work!
* Other
  * If you want to do a checkin for a project, let me know and we'll schedule one!
  * Make up your own! What's an idea that's important to you? What's a topic that's interesting?
  * Learn a language we haven't even discussed, like [Elm](http://elm-lang.org),
    [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/),
    [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
  * Build a database! I've never done this, but I've been wanting to. We might totally fail! ♥️
  * What's a vim thing you've seen me do that you want to learn?
    What's an editing task that's annoyed you that we could try to find a way to address?
  * What's something you previously struggled with that you want to give another go?
  * Can you still write all the linked list functions?
  * Do you want to make a waypoint out of that server? It may have taken you 2 weeks, but think how much you learned along the way.
    All the things I was bad at, I practiced until I was good at them.
    You could get that thing that took you two weeks down to 30 minutes O.o
    Seriously, we could do that.
  * [This](http://codingbat.com/) site has some amazing challenges for Java and Python
    (I like the Java ones best) I could teach you just enough Java to get started with it.
    I learned *sooooo* much by going through that one!
    To the point that I even styled the challenges after it!
  * [Here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/4574453) is a minimal example of how to make a C extension!
    That's useful if you want to do some kind of processing at a low-level!
  * [Here](http://codingbat.com/python) are some resources on Django, and [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)
    is some material to help teach you Python and algorithmic thinking, both of those would be relevant!
