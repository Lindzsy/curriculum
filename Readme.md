Curriculum for CodePlatoon
==========================

This plan should be in place by 2nd Week of Dec.
Class begins the first(ish) week of Feb, and lasts 4 mo.

Format
------

Split into 3 main sections, with some amount of overlap between each section,
as we choose appropriate ways to end a third which prepare them for the next one.


To Add
------

- Sprinkle challenges liberally throughout
- Concrete demonstrations of knowledge each day
- Reflection opportunities
- Opportunities to go back and redo challenges they did previously (anchor the knowledge)
