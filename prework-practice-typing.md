Prework: Practice Typing
========================

Your typing speed matters. It matters far far more than most people realize.
It isn't about how quickly you can get some text on the screen, it's about
how many hurdles are between the spark of a thought and its manifestation on your screen.

When you type well, you optimize for typing: you type in tandem with thinking,
thus the disparity between your thought and the computer is minimal.
This grants you quick guiding feedback.

When you type poorly, you optimize against typing: you do your thinking independently,
and thus rely much more heavily on your brain's ability to play computer.
Your brain is bad at this task. If you are inhibited by typing, you will suffer
a constant cloud of confusion. You will frequently lose information because
you couldn't cache it in your brain long enough to transfer it to your computer.

Your typing affects your behaviour, and as a consequence,
poor typing skills can utterly cripple a new developer.

Fortunately, typing is a hard-skill. Focus on it carefully, being attentive to precision,
correcting mistakes, pushing yourself to improve... and you will!


Foundation
----------

First type [this challenge](http://10fastfingers.com/text/52616-little-book-of-talent-tip8), it pertains to what we are doing here.

Then beat the [top 1000](http://10fastfingers.com/top1000) (most frequent words in the English language) on Softcore Mode
If you struggle with this, then alternate between going as fast as you can and being as precise as you can.
Don't practice these for more than 20 minutes at a time, breaks are good :)


Code and Prose
--------------

Here are a bunch of samples I uploaded. I haven't gone through them all on the site, so there may be some rough edges.
Code and prose are interleaved as I expect the variation to be valuable.

The purpose of the code samples is to gets you typing common programming characters and terms
and to exposes you to common structures and patterns in code. I also chose real-world code samples
to prime you for when you go to read them. I didn't read code for years, and one reason was that
it seemed formidable and far away. Hopefully this will help you realize it's more immediate than it seems :)

The purpose of the prose is to give you a sense of speed that is difficult to achieve in the code
(to be fair, you don't type code straight through like this, you use editors and IDEs specifically intended for it.)
After typing quicker in the prose, I hope you'll feel a sense of slowness in the code that will
cause you to try harder to speed it up.

For the prose, I also chose excerpts from the Little Book of Talent,
[with permission](https://twitter.com/DanielCoyle/status/667797548036440065) form its author, Daniel Coyle.
The purpose of the prose is to keep your brain entertained while your fingers learn the skills.
It is also to get you thinking about effective learning habits.
