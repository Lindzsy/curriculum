DEVOPS:
======= 
  
Basics of Operations
-----------------------
  
  Week2: Seems like a good place to discuss basics of Operations.  Good place to explain a high level overview of Networking, Servers (Virtual, Cloud), Security, Infrastructure as Code, etc.  My idea would be to guide the class to seeing the big picture. Where they fit in a larger organization and bring up early DevOps practices like communication, empathy, and culture.

“DevOps practices like communication, empathy, and culture” Can you explain a bit more about what this means?
“Networking / Servers / Security / Infrastructure as Code” Lets move this to week 6, when they're building their server / app.

Continuous Integration
------------------------

Week 3: Probably a good point for going over Continuous Integration.  We could go over taking code checked into Github and having it tested with TravisCI.  

Lets move this to week 6, when they'll have a larger project that they're pairing on. This way they'll see the value (trusting the code they pull, and knowing they're not breaking their team's build).

Infrastructure as Code
-----------------------

  Week 4: Looks like you'll have a package at this stage.  Might be a good place to fully introduce Infrastructure as Code.  I can go over Ansible on how to provision a Vagrant box (or Cloud VM) on provisioning servers to run application code.  We can then integrate this step into the prior week's lesson regarding TravisCI.

Lets move this to the second phase (week 8 or  9 or 10), when they get into hosting their apps online. It would probably make more sense when they get to their Rails project and want to put it online (ie they'll see the value at that time, but probably not understand how its relevant at this time)

Application Architecture
-------------------------

  Week 6: I can talk about application architecture at this junction.  They should already have a working model of CI/CD and be capable of deploying code onto a server.  If they are to be building a webserver then it's reasonable to assume that we could deploy their application using Travis to have an Internet accessible app.

If we can get their server onto a production machine (I'm strongly in preference of Digital Ocean), that would be a great way to make it concretely available to them. I'm skeptical of using a tool at this stage, though, it's probably better to see how the pieces fit before they begin automating them. How much effort would it take to get that into place?

Additional Topics
-----------------

  Beyond week 6 I'm not too sure where I could really benefit.  Basics of Devops are covered.  I could be helpful in providing more details on how things work with an operations perspective?  Topics like what is AWS and going over how it's changing the industry?  

This would make sense in late phase 2, as well, I think.
