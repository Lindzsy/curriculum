Requirements will not be given, but must rather be gathered!


Our Agile Process
-----------------

* Figure out what your crazy user actually wants and why
* Break these down into user stories:
  1-sentence descriptions of who the user is, what they want, and why.
* Write each story on an index card.
* On the back, write the set of steps I will take to see that it works,
  write down details about what will probably be created / touched / modified.
* Prioritize stories according to value added / dependencies
  (ie if a story can't be completed before another story, that story must come first)
* Completing stories
  * Each group takes the next highest priority story
  * Use Capybara to walk through the app in the same way that I will walk through it
  * That is what you / your pair are working on
  * Only work on that story, do only what is specified on the card
  * Once complete, present it to your user.
    If it works, they will accept the work, and you can take the next story
