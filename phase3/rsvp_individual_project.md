RSVP Individual Project
=======================

This one will be an individual project using a subset of the things we've learned up to this point.

Stories
-------


#### The host

```
As someone who hosts events,
I want a convenient way to invite people
and know who is planning on attending.
When I go to the main page of the site,
I see form that lets me enter details for my event.
I enter "Josh's Birthday Party" for the title
And I enter "14 March 2017" for the date
And I enter "8:00 PM" for the time
And I enter "8492 Main st." for the location
And I enter "Come celebrate my birthday!" for the description
When I submit the form
I see that I'm on a page where I can sign up.
```


#### An attendee

```
As someone who wants to attend Josh's birthday party
When he gives me a link to the event
I see the title is "Josh's Birthday Party"
And I see the date is "14 March 2017"
And I see the time is "8:00 PM"
And I see the location is "8492 Main st."
And I see the description is "Come celebrate my birthday!"
I see that there are no attendees
I see a form where I can RSVP
When I enter "Brant Faulkner" into the form and submit it
Then am left on the same page
But now I see that "Brant Faulkner" is listed as an attendee
```


#### Other features

Once you get the above working, here are other featuers to consider adding:

* The date/time must be in the future
* People cannot RSVP after the event
* The event creator can edit the page (this doesn't require authentication, just remembering which events I created)
* Attendees can leave additional information, eg if the even is a potluck, I could use this to list what I'll be bringing.
* Allow attendees to provide an email, as well
* When I sign up, the page is updated without a refresh
