## Turing Module 4
(missing "Realtime" and ideabox -- in the curriculum repo)
Projects
* Scale-up: pagination / infinite scrolling
* Ideabox - gets them to make the mistakes that led to many of the common patterns
* [Game Time](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
build their own game
put OO ideas into practice
* [The Scale Up](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)
(might get cut)
Talk to Rails
pagination and such
* Realtime
Rails or Node for the backend
Uses websockets
This is really a design project
* [Flack](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown)
This has been replaced by Realtime b/c they weren't completing it
Make a Slack clone
